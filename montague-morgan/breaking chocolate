// pseudocode part
// n and m can't be zero, that would just be empty space
// find area of by multiplying n and m
// can find this using an if else statement
// smallest square is 1 so if we have a number greater than 1 subtract one
// following this train of thought, if size is still larger than 0, there are breakable pieces left to count
// else since no more breakable pieces return 0
