// need to combine two strings with just. This strings only contain letters a to z, they can be repeated though
// after combining the two strings into s3 we need to loop them 
// we can set a conditional with if, if i, which is is looped for each letter in s3, isn't included in the array
// we can then push the nonincluded into the array
// using the sort method, sorts arrays by alphabetically
// we need to change this array into a string, we use .join '' with an empty string so there is no space
